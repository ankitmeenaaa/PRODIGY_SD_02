# Number Guessing Game

This C++ program is a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the user's guess is too high or too low, and counts the number of attempts until the user guesses correctly.

## Features

- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Prompts the user for their guess.
